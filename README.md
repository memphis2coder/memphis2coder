### Hi there, I'm Antonio! <img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e8e7b06ecf583bc040eb60e44eb5b8e0ecc5421320a92929ce21522dbc34c891/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e67697068792e636f6d2f6d656469612f6876524a434c467a6361737252346961377a2f67697068792e676966" width="30px">

I'm a self-taught web developer from Northern Virginia. My passion for the web lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with code. I take great care in the user experience, architecture and code quality of the things I build.
